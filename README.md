## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt that when you use the"position: absolute" for an element, it positions an element absolutely to the nearest parent element with a specified position property.

Also learnt a few others while working on this but I'd just call them futher learning as i already knew the basics and had to apply them.

### Continued development

I'd continue to practice and sharpen my skills.
